    <p>I am the owner of <a href="http://bluegrasspiano.com/">BluegrassPiano.com</a> and have been immensely benefited by Roger Bennett's Southern Gospel piano techniques and suggestions. Last year a friend wrote and mentioned that the link to this website (from <a href="http://bluegrasspiano.com/">BluegrassPiano.com</a>) was broken. I was very surprised and disappointed to learn that it had become nearly impossible to purchase Roger Bennett's instruction information any longer.</p>
    <p>After the domain expired I picked it in case it was overlooked. I then contacted <a href="http://www.legacyfive.com/">Legacy Five</a> and asked if they knew more about it. I offered to help in any way possible and was happy to give the domain to them if they wanted it. They got in touch with Mrs. Bennett and then told me that she was planning to put the products onto the Legacy Five store. I plan to update this when the materials go live (and if you see they are, please let me know below), but for now, they will be hard to find.</p>

    <img src="/roger-bennett.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 0 0 15px 15px;" alt="Roger Bennett, the Southern Gospel pianist" />
    <p>Roger Bennett was born on March 10, 1959 in Strawberry, Arkansas. As he mentioned in his <em>Southern Gospel Piano Course (Volumes 1 and 2)</em>, he developed a love for southern gospel music at a young age. Bennett started playing piano when he was 7 years old and the first song that he learned was Heart and Soul. He enjoyed the song so much that he played it endlessly: until his parents forced him to take piano lessons so he could learn other songs. At the age of 9, he started taking piano lessons from Ms. Wallace.</p>
    <p>She, unlike many piano teachers, <em>encouraged</em> him to play by ear. Bennett said that he believed that was the difference in him being part of Southern Gospel music. Her encouragement allowed him to become comfortable transposing, and playing songs without written music. He played piano for a few more years and enjoyed it - but then something happened when he was about 13 years old. He heard his first record, one by the Florida Boys, and was changed for the rest of his life. He became almost obsessed with Southern Gospel music, and copied the piano parts from every single record that he could find.</p>
    <p>This determination paid off as he learned fundamental and key licks that those Southern Gospel pianists were doing. When Bennett was 20, he joined the Cathedrals and played with them for about 20 years. When the Cathedrals retired, Bennett formed Legacy Five with the former Cathedral band member, Scott Fowler.</p>
    <p>Roger Bennett left us with several solo albums that he recorded while he was still with us. In addition, he wanted to help other aspiring artists learn Southern Gospel piano and recorded a course for learning the style. His passion for playing the piano and his incredible skill come through the teaching material to make an un-matched product.</p>
