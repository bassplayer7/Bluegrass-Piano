<p>Having piano as part of Bluegrass is fantastic, and a part of Bluegrass that I would love to see grow and expand. I hope to put suggestions on here eventually, but for now, learn the basics on the piano, and, of course, listen to Bluegrass music. The piano is a very flexible instrument. It can be it's own band (there are many, many records that have been recorded like this), or it can be part of a band, obviously. It's range of sounds and styles (exciting, depressing, calming, energizing, and more) seems infinite, which makes it a perfect addition to the Bluegrass genre.</p>

<p>What exactly is Bluegrass Piano?<br />
Actually, that is something that is yet to be defined. I view it as piano played, typically, but not always, in a lively, major, way with other Bluegrass instruments. Think banjo, guitar, or mandolin.</p>

<p>How would I go about learning Bluegrass Piano?<br />
This is a great question. At this point, I'm working on that part as well. Personally, I have worked more on Southern Gospel, and Gospel, in general styles. I have liked and used <a href="http://rogerbennettdirect.com/htmlpages/videos.html">Roger Bennet's Southern Gospel Piano Course Volume 1 &amp; 2</a> which I would recommend going through.</p>
