    <p>Having piano as part of Bluegrass is fantastic, and a part of Bluegrass that I would love to see grow and expand. Following are a few suggestions on how to play Bluegrass Piano. To start, though, learn the basics on the piano, and, of course, listen to Bluegrass music. The piano is a very flexible instrument. It can be it's own band (there are many, many records that have been recorded like this), or it can be part of a band, obviously. It's range of sounds and styles (exciting, depressing, calming, energizing, and more) seems infinite, which makes it a perfect addition to the Bluegrass genre.</p>

    <div id="bluegrass-piano">
        <h2>What exactly is Bluegrass Piano?</h2>
        <p>It is not rocket science.</p>
        <dl id="definition">
        <dt>Bluegrass Piano:</dt>
        <dd>A reasonably new style of piano that would come close to Southern Gospel piano, with a touch of country in it. It is typically played in a band setting with other Bluegrass instruments such as the guitar, bass, and fiddle, but is not limited to this. Often, lively and major (but perhaps a little bluesy) techniques, with an apparent lack of the sustain pedal would describe this style overall. As one would expect with Bluegrass music, harder arrangements are almost always better, as long as it doesn't muddy the water (sound).</dd>

    <div id="how-to-learn">
        <h2>How would I go about learning Bluegrass Piano?</h2>
        <p>At this point, I'm working on that part as well, and don't think I'll ever "arrive". Personally, I have worked more, in general, on Southern Gospel, and Gospel styles.</p>
        <p>I have liked and used <a href="http://rogerbennettdirect.com/htmlpages/videos.html">Roger Bennet's Southern Gospel Piano Course Volume 1 &amp; 2</a> which I would recommend going through.</p>
        <p>I believe that playing by ear should be accompanied with the knowledge of how to play from a book. If all one knows how to do is play out of the book, I think their abilities become somewhat limited. They can improve this by learning to write and arrange music, but while I know people who can picture the music and write it, that is something I simply can't do. I have to play it in order to really hear what it sounds like. As a result, this has led me to see that ultimately, one does themselves a huge service by knowing how to play by ear, and out of the book.</p>
        <p>If you do well with reading music, and are looking to learn the Bluegrass piano style, I recommend getting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K6CRNM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000K6CRNM&linkCode=as2&tag=bluegpiano-20">Stan Whitmire's Old Time Gospel Piano book</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=bluegpiano-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000K6CRNM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Yes, it doesn't say it's "Bluegrass", but many of the principles in those arrangements are excellent. It is some intense piano music, and if you aren't proficient with reading music when you start into the piano book, I think you will be when you finish. Be sure to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BY4U28/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001BY4U28&linkCode=as2&tag=bluegpiano-20">companion album</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=bluegpiano-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001BY4U28" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> so you can appreciate what it is supposed to sound like.</p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of practical theory. Some theory gets rather high-level, and that's fine for those who want to dedicate the time it requires to learn it, but for me, I'd rather learn the fundamentals, and then turn on my keyboard, and make it do something. I highly recommend, <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/">MusicTheory.net</a> as an excellent source of almost all of the theory that I think is needed to learn the piano. Pick up their <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/products/tenuto">exercise app</a> and <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/products/lessons">instruction app</a> if you can. They are very well done, and worth the small price.</p>
        <p>If you are learning to improve your play-by-ear capabilities, I think you should consider getting <a href="http://www.hearandplay.com/go/?p=bluegras&w=gk101">Jermaine Griggs Gospel Keys 101</a>. While I have most of his products, I am of the opinion that this outshines the rest of them in a big way. It is for beginners, but I would recommend it to anyone that is not familiar with playing the piano by hear or doesn't use the Nashville number system. </p>
        <p>One thing to note is that I'm not necessarily talking about the "ear-training" that is taught in some of the classical circles where one looks at a note on a page, or perhaps even hears it, and then knows what that note sounds like, or what it is, respectively. While that is an excellent skill, I am primarily speaking of the type of playing by ear that comes natural for most people. For example, almost everyone knows the tune of "Mary Had a Little Lamb", or "Amazing Grace". With that in mind, it wouldn't take most people long at all to play that melody on the piano. In the same sense, it isn't hard to then build on that skill and to mix the creative side of the mind, and learned part to create something beautiful.</p>

    <div id="piano-vs-keyboard">
        <h2>Piano vs. Keyboard:</h2>
        <p>I have two main thoughts on this issue:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If it has at least 66 white/black keys, works, is in tune, and sounds like a piano you should be set.</li>
            <li>If it doesn't have at least 66 white/black keys, doesn't work, isn't in tune, or doesn't sound like a piano, try to find something that does work (or tune the piano). </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I suppose it's stating the obvious, but also, if you don't care for keyboards, I'd recommend getting a piano instead. </p>
