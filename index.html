    <p>Having piano as part of Bluegrass is fantastic, and a part of Bluegrass that I would love to see grow and expand. Following are a few suggestions on how to play Bluegrass Piano. Start, though, learn the basics on the piano, and, of course, listen to Bluegrass music. The piano is a very flexible instrument. It can be it's own band (there are many, many records that have been recorded like this), or it can be part of a band, obviously. It's range of sounds and styles (exciting, depressing, calming, energizing, and more) seems infinite, which makes it a perfect addition to the Bluegrass genre.</p>

    <p>What exactly is Bluegrass Piano?<br />
    Actually, that is something that is yet to be defined. I view it as piano played, typically, but not always, in a lively, major, way with other Bluegrass instruments. Think banjo, guitar, or mandolin.</p>

    <h3>How would I go about learning Bluegrass Piano?</h3>
    <p>This is a great question. At this point, I'm working on that part as well. Personally, I have worked more, in general, on Southern Gospel, and Gospel styles. I have liked and used <a href="http://rogerbennettdirect.com/htmlpages/videos.html">Roger Bennet's Southern Gospel Piano Course Volume 1 &amp; 2</a> which I would recommend going through.</p>

    <p>I believe that playing by ear should be accompanied with the knowledge of how to play from a book.</p>

    <p>I am a huge fan of practical theory. Some theory gets rather high-level, and that's fine for those who want to dedicate the time it requires to learn it, but for me, I'd rather learn the fundamentals, and then turn on my keyboard, and make it do something. I highly recommend, <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/">MusicTheory.net</a> as an excellent source of almost all of the theory that I think is needed to learn the piano. Pick up their apps if you can. They are very well done, and worth it.</p>
