# Bluegrass Piano
I play keyboard in a mostly Bluegrass band and am not sure when I had the idea of playing what I now call "Bluegrass Piano", but I decided I would dedicate a website to that.

This repository runs the [__site__](http://bluegrasspiano.com) that is intended for people wanting to know more about how to play Bluegrass piano or keyboard and it also provides me a great playground as I learn web development.

With it, I have enjoyed experimenting with new ideas, and implementing things that I have learned and want to practice. As with most things, practice makes perfect and this website has allowed me that.
